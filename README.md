## Project overview

* As a user, I want to be able to research various National Parks by state and be able to understand...
** Park name
** Park hours
** Park address
** Park description
** Park activities

* As a user, I want flexibility in searching by state as well as using my device's location. The latter feature is possible while visiting a park and enhances their experience to have information at their fingertips.

## Site design

* This project enabled us to learn a new styling site & fast! We chose Materialize for it's familiarity with CSS files and its catalog of options. We reveled in the ease of centering items (the word "center" finally centers an element) and we stumbled at times before realizing script placement was key for unfamiliar features.

## National Park Service (NPS) API

* Discovering this particular API was relief to our initial challenges. Our group initially had its eye on a trails API from another website. After extensive testing and realizing the API was not working for others in recent years, we had to quickly regroup and adjust our plans. Lesson learned to ensure the API works well before heading down a project trail.

* The NPS API allowed for a plethora of end points and results. Some parks have 5-10 activities while others have over 50. We tapered these results for a more realistic user experience while still providing many options.
