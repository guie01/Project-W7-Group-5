## Project overview

* As a user, I want to be able to research various National Parks by state and be able to understand...
** Park name
** Park hours
** Park address
** Park description
** Park activities

* As a user, I want to call for my location and render a map. This feature is possible while visiting a park and enhances their experience to have information at their fingertips.

* Recent search history by state is rendered on-screen as the user traverses the API. The search is cleared when window is closed.

## Site design

* This project enabled us to learn a new styling site & fast! We chose Materialize for it's familiarity with CSS files and its catalog of options. We reveled in the ease of centering items (the word "center" finally centers an element) and we stumbled at times before realizing script placement was key for unfamiliar features.

## API

* Discovering this particular API was relief to our initial challenges. Our group initially had its eye on a trails API from another website. After extensive testing and realizing the API was not working for others in recent years, we had to quickly regroup and adjust our plans. Lesson learned to ensure the API works well before heading down a project trail.

* The NPS API allowed for a plethora of end points and results. Some parks have 5-10 activities while others have over 50. We tapered these results for a more realistic user experience while still providing many options.

* GeoLocation API by Google was a challenge - Richie takes all the credit here for spending hours understanding the API and how to render the map down to the push-pin location details.

## What we're proud of most in ten words or less:

* Matt: "I love Parallex."
* Guillermo: "Everything."
* Richie: "Getting this freakin' Google API to work."
* Stefanie: "Materialize is my spirit animal, "class = center" means center."

## Future enhancements

* The sky is the limit, but here are a few of our future features:
** Search by park name
** Search by city
** Add weather forecast
